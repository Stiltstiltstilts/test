Hi—thanks for being interested in my work ☺

I am a scientist studying how minds, music, and culture interact. This has led me to do research on topics ranging from [how the language you speak shapes how you perceive music](https://cosmosmagazine.com/people/native-language-rhythm-melody/), to [how the sound of 'baby talk' varies around the world](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/24/science/parentese-babies-global-language.html).

I am also interested in rethinking what psychology experiments look like. I do this by applying ideas from citizen science and gamification to study larger and more diverse groups of people over the internet. Participate in my latest citizen science study [here](https://www.themusiclab.org/quizzes/toneguesser).

You can find the full list of my published research on my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=egRtkI0AAAAJ&hl=en).

I did [my PhD](https://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/bitstream/handle/2123/24230/Thesis_revision_clean.pdf?sequence=2) at the University of Sydney. I then worked for two years as a postdoc at Harvard in [The Music Lab](https://www.themusiclab.org/). In 2023, the lab and I both moved to the University of Auckland in New Zealand, which is where I currently work.

I grew up in the country town of [Gidgegannup](https://goo.gl/maps/Jg5GUTxj3RePSgJV8) in Western Australia and originally trained as a musician before becoming a scientist.
