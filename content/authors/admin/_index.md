Courtney is a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Harvard Music Lab. He grew up in the small country town of Gidgegannup in Western Australia, and initially trained as a musician. Today he applies ideas from cognitive and data science to ask big questions about the nature of music and the mind. In his spare time he makes music, plays chess, and worships the 20th century philosopher and scientist William James.
