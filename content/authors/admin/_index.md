Courtney is a postdoctoral fellow in the [Harvard Music Lab](https://www.themusiclab.org/). He grew up in the small country town of [Gidgegannup](https://goo.gl/maps/Jg5GUTxj3RePSgJV8) in Western Australia, and initially trained as a [musician](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHGjIWIXCNN54zdhzuufIcw). 

Today he applies ideas from cognitive and data science to ask big questions about the nature of music and the mind. Sometimes also exploring questions about language (and especially its intersections with music), or questions about human learning and educational design. Recently he has also been exploring new ways of doing research using online citizen science. In his spare time he makes [music](https://twitter.com/courtneybhilton/status/1397005394871005192), plays [chess](https://lichess.org/@/Stiltstiltstilts), and is currently obsessing about the ideas of [William James](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_James).
