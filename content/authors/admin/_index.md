Courtney is a postdoctoral fellow in the [Harvard Music Lab](https://www.themusiclab.org/). He grew up in the small country town of [Gidgegannup](https://goo.gl/maps/Jg5GUTxj3RePSgJV8) in Western Australia, and initially trained as a [musician](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHGjIWIXCNN54zdhzuufIcw). 

Today he applies ideas from cognitive and data science to ask questions about the nature of music and the mind. Sometimes his questions stray into other areas like language, technology, and human learning. And recently he has been exploring new ways of doing this research using [online citizen science](https://psyarxiv.com/uj9a6). 

In his spare time he makes [music](https://twitter.com/courtneybhilton/status/1397005394871005192), plays [chess](https://lichess.org/@/Stiltstiltstilts), and finds himself a bit in love with [William James](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_James).
