G'day! My name is Courtney. Nice to meet you ü§ù

I am a cognitive scientist who studies how minds, music, and culture interact. I like big datasets and fancy computational methods. I am particularly excited about developing new ways for psychology to collect data from larger and more diverse samples of people using *web-based citizen science*, and more generally rethinking what a 'psychology experiment' looks like.

I did my PhD at the University of Sydney before joining [The Music Lab](https://www.themusiclab.org/) at Harvard University, where I worked for two years. The lab then moved to New Zealand, where I am currently based in the School of Psychology at the University of Auckland.

I grew up in the small country town of [Gidgegannup](https://goo.gl/maps/Jg5GUTxj3RePSgJV8) in Western Australia. I originally trained as a musician and still make music as often as I can.
