Hi! My name is Courtney. I am a cognitive scientist who studies how minds, music, and culture interact. In other words, I'm interested in how YOU perceive, experience, and engage with music and how that is shaped by both your cultural background and your general psychological characteristics. I am particularly excited about answering these questions via web-based citizen science methods, allowing me to collect large and culturally diverse experimental datasets, which facilitate sophisticated computational methods. Sometimes I also do developmental experiments with babies, or work with anthropologists to conduct fieldwork.

I am currently a (postdoctoral) research fellow in the School of Psychology at the University of Auckland, where I work in [The Music Lab](https://www.themusiclab.org/). I originally joined the lab when it was based in the Department of Psychology at Harvard University, where I worked for 2 years. Prior to that I completed my PhD at the University of Sydney. And before that, I originally trained as a musician and classical guitarist, working with the great teacher Tim Kain at the Australian National University. I grew up in the small country town of [Gidgegannup](https://goo.gl/maps/Jg5GUTxj3RePSgJV8) in Western Australia. In my spare time, I make music, visual art, cook, play chess, and hang out with my partner and our two cats Dave and Gidge.
